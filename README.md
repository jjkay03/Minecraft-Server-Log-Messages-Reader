# Minecraft-Server-Log-Messages-Reader
Count and save all messages sent by players on a server using the logs.

To use it all you have to do is paste all your logs in a folder called `logs` in the same directory as the python script and run it.

(You might also need to create a folder called `players messages` if it doesn't work)


# What does it output?
In the console you should see how many messages each player has sent on the server and in the `players messages` folder you will find `.txt` files with each player's name containing all the messages they have sent.

# Not working?
With no modifications this will only work with logs from sevres that use default vanilla chat formating.

# Output exemeple:
